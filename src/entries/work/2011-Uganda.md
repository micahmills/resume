Assisting with the training and development of leaders and systems in churches and non-governmental organizations doing relief work throughout Uganda, specifically to those with Disabilities.
- Oversaw the construction of several buildings at the organizations training center.
- Built and maintained a custom web application that allowed the organization to more easily track the progress of their projects and the people they were serving. Constrained by limited internet access and a lack of power, the application was built as a client side application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and stored data locally in an SQLite database that was synced with the server when a connection was available.
