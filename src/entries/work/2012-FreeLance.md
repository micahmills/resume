Designing and Developing web sites, apps and tools for companies, and non-profits around the globe.
- As I transitioned from life in rural Africa before relocating to mega-city Istanbul, Turkey I focused on developing high quality performant sites and applications that take into account the end users unique needs and restraints. Having lived and worked in countries on multiple continents, I have a deep understanding of developing web sites and applications with multiple cultures and languages in mind. In addition to working with individuals, companies, and non-profits, I have found opportunities to contribute to open source projects that are used around the world.
