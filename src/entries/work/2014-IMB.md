Serving as a missionary to the persecuted church in Central Asia.
- For the past 8 years, I have created digital content for evangelism, discipleship, and church planting to assist our national partners in engaging with the least reached people in a closed Central Asian country. In an effort to better serve the local church in these hard to reach places, I immersed myself in two languages to gain understanding in developing culturally appropriate resources. Closed countries present unique challenges in creating evangelistic content. As a result, I developed a progressive web app in 23 Central Asian languages to provide access to the bible and evangelistic content for these people groups. Over the past few years, I have worked with a team, utilizing open source platforms, to develop and deploy a customer relationship management system for disciple makers. This tool allows workers worldwide to track their digital and face-to-face relationships, along with churches, discipleship groups, and leadership trainings that emerge from their work.
