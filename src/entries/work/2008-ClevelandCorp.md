Internal IT support and client facing technical support for an educational technology company.
- Working as a client facing technician I provided support for hardware and software problems related to SMART boards and other education related audio/visual equipment for schools and teachers in the Midwest. Additionally, I served as internal IT support for Windows and Mac computers, network, phone, wireless, and mobile devices for 100+ users (local and remote). As a facilitator for large and small group technical training seminars, I educated external clients and our internal staff on software, hardware, and best practices.
