Serving as a missionary to the persecuted church in Central Asia.
- For the past 8 years, I have created digital content for evangelism, discipleship, and church planting to assist in the missionary work across Central Asia. In an effort to better serve the local church in these hard to reach places, I immersed myself in two languages to gain understanding in developing culturally appropriate resources. As a result of the difficulties in getting Christian content into a generally Muslim context, I developed a progressive web app in 23 Central Asian languages to provide access to the bible and evangelistic content for these people groups. Over the past few years, I have worked with a team, utilizing open source platforms, to develop and deploy a customer relationship management system for churches and those working in overseas context. This tool allows workers worldwide to track their digital and face-to-face relationships, along with churches, discipleship groups, and leadership trainings that emerge from their work.
