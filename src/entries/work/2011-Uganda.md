Assisting with the training and development of leaders and systems in non-governmental organizations doing relief work throughout Uganda, specifically to those with Disabilities.
- Oversaw and managed the construction of several buildings at the organizations training center in Uganda.
- Built and maintained a custom web application that allowed the organization to more easily track progress of hundreds of people that needed disability assistance. Constrained by limited internet access and a lack of power, the application was built as a client side application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and stored data locally in an SQLite database that was synced with the server when a connection was available.
