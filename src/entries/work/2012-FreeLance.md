Designing and Developing web sites, apps and tools for companies, and non-profits around the globe.

- As a Freelance Developer I have had the opportunity to work with many teams, companies, and organizations to produce products to meet the unique needs of their users. I have been part of the entire development process from initial planning and market research to product design and development. My experience with backend technologies (PHP, Node.js, MySQL, NoSQL Databases) and frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript) has allowed me to work in the entirety of the development stack to make products that are both functional and beautiful.
