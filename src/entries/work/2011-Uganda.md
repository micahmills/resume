Assisting with the training and development of leaders and systems in churches and non-governmental organizations doing relief work throughout Uganda, specifically to those with Disabilities.
- As an apprentice to seasoned missionaries, I worked to learn the local language and culture, oversaw the construction of buildings at a developing training center, built and maintained web-sites and web applications, trained local churches on the sovereignty of God and suffering, and distributed wheelchairs giving dignity and hope to the disabled people of Uganda.
