Retail and inventory associate for Apple
- As a retail associate for Apple, I helped customers find solutions to their technology needs through sales, training, and support of hardware and software. Additionally, I maintained accurate inventory of over $2 million in consumer electronics and handled all inbound and outbound freight.
