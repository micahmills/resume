Assisted with the training and development of leaders and systems in non-governmental organizations doing relief work throughout Uganda, specifically to those with disabilities.
- Oversaw and managed the construction of several buildings at the organizationâ€™s training center in Uganda.
- Built and maintained a custom web application allowing the organization to seamlessly track the progress of hundreds of people that needed disability assistance. Constrained by limited internet access and electricity, the application was built as a client side application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and stored data locally in an SQLite database that was synced with the server when a connection was available.
